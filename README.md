🤖 AI Projects by Oktay Savdi

This repository contains AI-powered tools and experiments developed for cloud infrastructure, DevOps automation, and Kubernetes operations leveraging large language models like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek.

🔨 CodeGeneration

An AI agent that automates Terraform module generation using fine-tuned LLMs. It simplifies cloud infrastructure provisioning through intelligent prompts, error correction, and GitOps workflows.

 - ✅ Auto-generates Terraform modules 
 - ✅ Fixes validation errors automatically 
 - ✅ Integrates with GitHub/GitLab 
 - ✅ Supports multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, Azure OpenAI)

☸️ KubernetesChatbot

A chatbot application powered by a fine-tuned LLM, trained on Kubernetes knowledge. It answers questions about Kubernetes architecture, operations, and best practices via natural language.

 - ✅ Fine-tuned on Kubernetes-specific datasets
 - ✅ Natural language question answering
 - ✅ Flask-based web UI
 - ✅ Docker-compatible deployment

☸️ Kubernetes ChatOps Assistant

An AI-powered **Kubernetes assistant** that connects directly to your cluster and allows you to interact using **natural language**, without needing any knowledge of `kubectl` or CLI commands.

Built with a **fine-tuned large language model**, this assistant provides real-time insights about workloads, resources, errors, and general Kubernetes health, all via a simple chat interface.

- ✅ Fine-tuned on real-world Kubernetes datasets  
- ✅ Answers questions on architecture, workloads, and operations  
- ✅ Provides real-time insights using natural language  
- ✅ Flask-based web interface  
- ✅ It is Docker-compatible for easy deployment
